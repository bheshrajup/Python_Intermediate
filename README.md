└───To-Do-List-Project

### Concepts:
- **Dictionary/** – Working with Python dictionaries, key-value pairs, and related operations.
- **Functions/** – Exploring user-defined functions, arguments, and return values.
- **Lambda_Functions/** – Understanding anonymous functions and their use cases.
- **OOP/** – Object-Oriented Programming concepts, including classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Recursion/** – Implementing recursive functions and understanding recursion depth.

### Projects:
- **Simple_Bank_Account_System_Project/** – A basic banking system demonstrating account creation, deposits, and withdrawals.
- **To-Do-List-Project/** – A task management application for adding, updating, and deleting tasks.
- **Simple_Interest_Calculator_Project/** – A calculator to compute simple interest based on user inputs.

## Requirements
